1.  Elements - I could play around with the elements in the html and css of my site to get quicker visual understandings if i made a particular change or moved something around, i can also get a visual understanding of how my borders margins and and paddings are all behaving rather than trying to imagine it while staring at a css file.

    Network - I can use it to see size and load times of my files.

    Performance - test performance

    Console - I could find and troubleshoot errors in real time while developing the JS for my site, also i can interact with the JS im writing and see the output. i could also run it as jquerey.

    Application - not totally sure what this is about, but it looks like it stores information.

2. go to elements, select the html line i want to edit and double click the css i want to change that pops up under the styles tab.

3. in the style menu, you can click and filter pseudo-classes i.e. :hover and it will show those only in the style menu.

4. the Network tab

5. theres a button in the top left that lets u visually simulate your site on different devices and landscapes.

6. just make any change you want in the DOM and watch it change in real time, its all temporary until the page is reloaded.

7. 2.5
